/**
 * Diffie-Hellman key exchange based on elliptic curve 25519.
 *
 * Curve 25519 is represented in Montgomery form. All coordinates are represented as
 * byte arrays in Little Endian byte order.
 *
 * Note that many elliptic curve crypto implementations for Java such as Bouncy/Spongy Castle
 * use the Weierstrass form rather than the Montgomery form. Moreover, BigInteger as used by
 * these implementations stores coordinates in BigEndian byte order. So if you need to exchange
 * points with such implementations, you need to transform them first. Of course, you can use
 * the shared secret as is for symmetric encryption (e.g., AES) or authentication (e.g., HMAC)
 * also with these libraries.
